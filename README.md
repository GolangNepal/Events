**Date:** September 12, 2020

**Excerpt:**

Write and deploy eBPF userspace-probes native in Linux VMs v4.9+ to dynamically inject tracepoint in your Go programs with the following constraints:
* Less than 5% performance overhead
* Reliably start, deploy and stop probes without leaks.
* Provide apis to sample, filter and access data.

**Date:** December 5, 2020

**Excerpt:**

Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool that excels at expressing code standards — without complicated queries — and surfacing bugs early at editor, commit, and CI time. Precise rules look like the code you’re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling with regexes.
